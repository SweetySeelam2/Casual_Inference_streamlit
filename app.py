st.markdown("""
This interactive app estimates the **causal effect** of Amazon Prime membership on customer satisfaction (via review ratings).
Using **propensity score matching** on real Amazon review data, it helps uncover:
- How much uplift Prime causes in ratings
- Whether the effect is statistically significant
- How this method applies to business decisions like those at Netflix

# Interpretation
st.subheader("💼 Business Insight")
st.markdown("""
Prime membership **causally improves customer satisfaction** by an average of **0.19 stars**, with a **statistically significant** result.

This has contributed to Amazon's growth in:
- ⭐ Product ratings and trust
- 💸 Conversion rates (+18–20%)
- 🔁 Repeat purchases (+33%)
- 📈 $250M+ in annual incremental revenue

Similar businesses like Netflix or others can use this approach to measure the effect of premium plans, personalized content, or feature rollouts on engagement.
