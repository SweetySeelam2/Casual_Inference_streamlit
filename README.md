# 📊 Causal Impact of Amazon Prime Membership on Customer Behavior

**Live App:** [Click here to view the app](https://casual-inference-prime-membership.streamlit.app/)

---

## 🧠 Project Overview

This project investigates the **causal effect** of Amazon Prime membership on customer satisfaction using advanced statistical techniques such as **Propensity Score Matching (PSM)**. Rather than predicting outcomes, this project focuses on identifying whether being a Prime member **causes** a measurable improvement in behavior — specifically, product review ratings.

The project includes a full deployment via Streamlit, offering interactive data exploration, user uploads, real-time treatment effect estimation, and business impact storytelling.

## 🎯 Business Problem

Amazon invests heavily in Prime membership programs, but does Prime **truly cause** better user satisfaction, or are happier users just more likely to subscribe?

Quantifying the causal effect of Prime allows for:
- Better resource allocation
- Targeted marketing
- Strategic decision-making grounded in **cause-and-effect**, not correlation

---

## 📌 Objectives

- Estimate **Average Treatment Effect (ATE)** of Prime on review satisfaction
- Use **Propensity Score Modeling** and **Nearest Neighbor Matching** to compare statistically similar users
- Build an interactive Streamlit app for business analysts and data scientists
- Share how this model contributed to Amazon’s business success and how it can be adopted by companies like Netflix

## 💡 Netflix & Other Business Adaptation

Companies like **Netflix**, **Spotify**, or **Disney+** can adopt this causal framework to:
- Measure the impact of premium features or trials
- Analyze behavior post-content personalization or UI changes
- Inform A/B testing strategies with deeper statistical insight
